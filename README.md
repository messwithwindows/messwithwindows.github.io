This is the repo containing every single file that messwithwindows uses.

Since the Proxmox server is public (it was made by a Discord user called "vichingo455") you actually could dig into the code and find the credentials, the Owner of the server won't actually care!

## Rules
- Don't do anything illegal
- Don't power off others' VMs
- Don't power on too much VMs
- Don't overload/speedtest my internet
- Don't use this server for bypassing IP bans
- Don't change user password
- No heavy tasks

**If you do something bad on the VM, vichingo455 might take the ENTIRE Proxmox server down without pre-advise.**
